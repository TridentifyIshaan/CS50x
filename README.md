# Bank Management Project (BMP)
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/JOdbHUG2ZII
#### Description:
A project used to carry out bank functions like transactions, savings, account holding, loan sharing, etc.. in an organized way.
I have created a menu of different functions that perform various tasks that a good bank should do. Here, they are as follows:
1. NEW ACCOUNT - Creating a new bank account
2. DEPOSIT AMOUNT - Depositing more cash
3. WITHDRAW AMOUNT - Withdrawing cash
4. BALANCE ENQUIRY - Enquiring about the balance of the account
5. SIMPLE INTEREST - How much simple interest will be given to you
6. COMPOUND INTEREST - How much compound interest will be given to you
7. ALL ACCOUNT HOLDER LIST - It showcases a list of all account holders
8. CLOSE AN ACCOUNT - To close an account
9. MODIFY AN ACCOUNT - To modify account details
10. TYPES OF LOANS OFFERED - Showcasing types of loans offered
11. EXIT - To exit the loop

I have imported 4 modules - random, pickle, os, pathlib.
I have used the class method to do this project.
I have tried to make this project look like more of a real bank but there's a scope of betterment and a future scope where I will be trying out foreign exchange transactions.

Thank You!
